I just wanted to see if a Julia Jupyter notebook would render OK. I had good experience with Python Jupyter notebooks before.

But I've run into this issue with my `Untitled.ipynb`:

Presumably, it's not language-specific, and even not necessarily size-specific, and things can work one day and not work another day, judging from the discussion in that issue. That's frustrating...

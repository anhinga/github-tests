I just wanted to see if a Julia Jupyter notebook would render OK. I had good experience with Python Jupyter notebooks before in terms of their rendering on GitHub, e.g. here:

https://github.com/anhinga/synapses

But I've run into this issue with my `Untitled.ipynb`:

https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/issues/11

Presumably, it's not language-specific, and even not necessarily size-specific, and things can work one day and not work another day, judging from the discussion in that issue. That's frustrating...

The workaround is that this notebook renders fine on https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ :
